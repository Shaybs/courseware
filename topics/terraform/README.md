## Overview

Terraform is a tool developed by HashiCorp for building, changing and versioning infrastructure on public cloud services like: 
* AWS
* Azure
* Google Cloud Platform

Configuration files are used to define your infrastructure. 
Terraform can create an execution plan with these configurations which describes what Terraform is going to do in order to fulfil the desired state of the infrastructure defined in the configuration files. 
The plan can be executed to build the described infrastructure. 
This means that your infrastructure can be described as code, allowing you to have a blueprint of your data-center that can be versioned like any other piece of code.
